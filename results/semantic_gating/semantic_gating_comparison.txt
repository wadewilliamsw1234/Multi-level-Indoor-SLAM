EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
All three SLAM algorithms (visual, deep learning, and LiDAR-based)
suffer from perceptual aliasing in multi-floor environments.
Floor-based semantic gating effectively prevents cross-floor false
loop closures across all modalities.

======================================================================
                        KEY FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. LeGO-LOAM HAS HIGHEST CROSS-FLOOR RATE (75.3%)
   - Surprising: LiDAR geometric matching is MORE susceptible to
     cross-floor aliasing than expected
   - ISEC building has structurally similar floors (same corridors)
   - ICP converges on geometrically similar scans regardless of floor

2. ORB-SLAM3 HAS MODERATE CROSS-FLOOR RATE (70.7%)
   - DBoW2 bag-of-words visual matching finds many similar-looking
     corridors across floors
   - Higher pose count (19K vs 2K) leads to more candidate pairs

3. DROID-SLAM HAS LOWEST CROSS-FLOOR RATE (62.7%)
   - Learned correlation volumes are more discriminative
   - Operates at lower keyframe rate with selective matching
   - Still significant: 62.7% would be catastrophic without gating

4. ALL ALGORITHMS BENEFIT FROM SEMANTIC GATING
   - ORB-SLAM3: 3.6M false positives rejected
   - DROID-SLAM: 59K false positives rejected
   - LeGO-LOAM: 66K false positives rejected

======================================================================
                     ALGORITHM CHARACTERISTICS
======================================================================

ORB-SLAM3 (Visual SLAM)
  - Pros: Dense feature extraction, real-time capable
  - Cons: Sensitive to visual aliasing in repetitive environments
  - Semantic Benefit: HIGH - DBoW2 often matches similar textures

DROID-SLAM (Deep Learning SLAM)
  - Pros: Learned features more robust to appearance changes
  - Cons: Limited global loop closure in original implementation
  - Semantic Benefit: MODERATE - Better local matching, still needs gating

LeGO-LOAM (LiDAR SLAM)
  - Pros: Works in textureless environments, accurate geometry
  - Cons: ICP can converge on structurally similar geometry
  - Semantic Benefit: HIGH - Geometric similarity causes false matches

======================================================================
                     IMPLICATIONS FOR SLAM
======================================================================

WITHOUT SEMANTIC GATING:
  Algorithm      False Loop Closures    Consequence
  ------------   -------------------    --------------------------
  ORB-SLAM3      3,612,527              Severe trajectory collapse
  DROID-SLAM    59,333                 Moderate drift corruption
  LeGO-LOAM     65,567                 Geometric map distortion

WITH SEMANTIC GATING:
  - All false positives rejected at minimal computational cost
  - Only IMU processing required (no GPU, no model inference)
  - Multi-floor trajectory integrity preserved for all algorithms

======================================================================
                        RECOMMENDATION
======================================================================

For multi-floor SLAM deployments:

1. ALWAYS use semantic floor gating, regardless of algorithm choice
2. IMU-based elevator detection is sufficient (no LiDAR/vision needed)
3. Apply gating as early as possible in the loop closure pipeline
4. Consider floor labels as mandatory constraints, not soft priors

Implementation cost: ~10 lines of code per algorithm
Runtime overhead: Negligible (single floor label lookup per candidate)
Benefit: Prevents catastrophic map corruption in multi-floor buildings
